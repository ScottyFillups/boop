A multiplayer party game similar to [bumper balls from Mario Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27VH-0ua25k).

```

### Contributing

* __When adding a new feature, create a new branch: do not push to master__
* __Run `yarn run lint` before you commit__
  * Run `yarn run fix` to fix any fixable errors
* Use `yarn run dev` rather than `yarn run start`
* In a separate tab, run `yarn run watch` to make webpack build client code

When new code is merged to master, Travis will automatically deploy to Heroku. No need to deploy it yourself :smiley:
